Building a project with Typescript is awesome.

Building an app using some famous frameworks like Next.js where my Typescript configuration is predefined makes my life easier.

However, bringing Typescript to a server Nodejs app is a different story.

If you've ever set up a barebone Expressjs app with Typescript, you shall know how crazy it is to get it up and running.

That is the reason I create this repo.

## Requirements

Make sure your dependencies match these below:
- Node 16+
- Typescript 4.7+
- ts-node 10+

If you need to setup for older versions, you can check with the reference list I leave here.

I believe you will find out your answer.
